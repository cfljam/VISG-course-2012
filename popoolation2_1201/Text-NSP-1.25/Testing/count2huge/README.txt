1. Introduction: 
----------------

This program is a component of the N-gram Statistics Package that counvert 
the bigrams generated by count.pl to huge-count.pl for the same input text
and options.

2. Tests:
----------

2.1 Normal conditions:
----------------------

Tests written in testA*.sh test count2huge.pl under normal conditions.
Run normal-op.sh to run all test cases testA*.sh 

Test A1:	Tests on one general bigram files

Test A2:	Tests on split = 1 for the general bigram files

Test A3:	Tests on without split option

Test A4:	Tests on split option higher than total bigrams 


2.2 Error conditions:
----------------------

Tests written in testB*.sh test count2huge.pl under error conditions.
Run error-op.sh to run all test cases testB*.sh

Test B1:	Tests on destination already exists 


3. Conclusions:
---------------

We have tested program huge-combine.pl enough to conclude that it runs 
correctly. We have also provided the test scripts so that future versions of 
huge-combine.pl can be compared to the current version against these scripts.
