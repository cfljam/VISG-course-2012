 the most extravagant wedding of the year was karishma kapoor's marriage to her childhood friend sanjay kapur on september 29.
 karishma looked ravishing in the bridal lehenga designed by manish malhotra. 
the lehenga was light pink in colour embellished with chikan-work, sequins and kota-work.
the bridegroom was dressed in a sherwani. 
the wedding took place at her late grand father raj kapoor's bunglow.
i got married at rk house. the sangeet and all other celebrations were also held at the house. 
the wedding ceremony took place at the golf course in chembur, mumbai.
my reception was at rk studios. all other festivities -- and they went on for 20 days -- were at rk house.
papa [raj kapoor] had heard him casually somewhere and invited him for my sangeet.
i wore a lehenga bought from delhi for the wedding. for the reception, mummy [krishna raj kapoor] had made me a sari in silver. 
my husband fainted because he couldn't take the crowd. he fainted just before he was to climb on the ghodi [climbing the horse]. 
i fainted at my wedding. my lehenga was too heavy. plus, there were too many people. it was too much for me to handle.
