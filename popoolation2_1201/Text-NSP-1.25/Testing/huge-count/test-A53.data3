papa [raj kapoor] had heard him casually somewhere and invited him for my sangeet.
i wore a lehenga bought from delhi for the wedding. for the reception, mummy [krishna raj kapoor] had made me a sari in silver. 
my husband fainted because he couldn't take the crowd. he fainted just before he was to climb on the ghodi [climbing the horse]. 
i fainted at my wedding. my lehenga was too heavy. plus, there were too many people. it was too much for me to handle.
