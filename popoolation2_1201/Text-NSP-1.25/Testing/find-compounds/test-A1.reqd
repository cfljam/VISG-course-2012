"the greek diet, containing olive_oil, fruit and vegetables, is much healthier than that of the rest of europe," said filalithis. according to the professor, family plays an important role as far as the social environment is concerned. the greek family has preserved strong ties between its members. "studies abroad have shown that people who have never married or who are living alone after a divorce have a shorter life_expectancy than married people," he said. "another factor to consider is the level of social and financial development of the country", says filalithis, adding that greece is more developed and richer than central and east european countries.
