NAME
    INSTALL - Installation instructions for Text-NSP

SYNOPSIS
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
        cd Testing
        csh ./ALL-TESTS.sh
        cd ..
        make clean

DESCRIPTION
  Dependencies
    Getopt::Long : to support command line options, very likely already
    installed on your system with Perl

  Detailed Installation Instructions
    If you have superuser (root) access, you should be able to install
    Text::NSP by following these simple steps:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test  
        su         # or sudo, as the case may be
        make install

        cd Testing # optional, but recommended
        csh ./ALL-TESTS.sh 
        cd ..

        make clean

    If you need to install this distribution in your local user account
    because you lack superuser privileges, then the recommended method on
    Unix-like systems (Linux, Solaris, Cygwin) is as follows:

        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/MyNSP LIB=~/MyPerlLib
        make
        make test
        make install
        cd Testing 
        csh ./ALL-TESTS.sh 
        cd ..

    This will install the executable scripts into ~/MyNSP/bin, the man pages
    in ~/MyPerlLib/man, and the libraries into ~/MyPerlLib.

    You will need to set your PERL5LIB variable to point to the LIB
    directory.

    In bash:

        export PERL5LIB=~/MyPerlLib

    In csh or tcsh:

        setenv PERL5LIB ~/MyPerlLib

    Add these lines to your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .cshrc files as the
    case may be.

     bin/utils/        : directory that contains several useful programs

                         rank.pl: compare two measures of association
                         kocos.pl: find kth order co-occurrences
                         combig.pl: find unordered counts of bigrams

     t/                : directory of test scripts that run with "make test"

     Testing/          : directory of test scripts for each program in NSP.
                         You can run these to make sure your installation is
                         working, and also to see some sample usages. Each
                         program tested has its own directory within Testing
                         in which you can find a README.txt file that describes
                         the testing process. Please note that "make test" above
                         does *not* run these tests.  They must be run separately
                         after installation is complete. This style of testing
                         has mostly been depricated, while we keep these tests
                         running for the new versions, we are putting all of 
                         our news tests into t/. 

     lib/              : directory where measures modules are found.
