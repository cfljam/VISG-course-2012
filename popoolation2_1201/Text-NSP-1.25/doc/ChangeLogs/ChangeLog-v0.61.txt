Measures
--------

(1)    	repaired the measures rightFisher.pm and leftFisher.pm. The
	measure had become reversed some where down the line and then
	there were a few errors in the rightFisher module. I revised
	the rightFisher so as it sums the hypergeometric probabitilies
	where n11 is greater than or equal to the observed value. And 
	similiarly with leftFisher only where n11 is less than or equal 
	to the observed value.  
	
Testing
-------	

(1)     Revised the test scripts for the leftFisher test:
		test-1.sub-4.reqd

(2)     Tested both rightFisher and leftFisher with the cooresponding
	test scripts
