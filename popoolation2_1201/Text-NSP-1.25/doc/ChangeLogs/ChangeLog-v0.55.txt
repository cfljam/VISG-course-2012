Measures
--------

(1)	Added tmi3.pm, a 3-D (trigram) implementation of true mutual 
        information.


Utils
-----

(1)	socs.pl and kocos.pl now include options 
	--literal WORD => to specify target WORD directly on a command line
	--regex FILE => to use a Perl Regex for specifying target word and its 
	morphological variants from a FILE 

Testing
-------	

(1)     Added test cases for ll3 and tmi that were inadvertently left out
	of v0.53. 

(2)     Added test cases for the new module tmi3.

(3)     Changed test cases to use the new options --literal and --regex.
        The test cases were not changed in any other way.
