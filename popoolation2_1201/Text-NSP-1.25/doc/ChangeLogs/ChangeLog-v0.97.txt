Measures
--------

The NSP versions 0.91, 0.93 and 0.95 were significantly slower than 
NSP-0.73. This was primarily due to the use of Objects. In this release 
all the measures have been rewritten without using objects. The hierarchy  
of the Measures has been maintained, and thus there is very little or no 
code duplication.

Another reason for the performance degradation was the policy of not using 
object variables. This resulted in more data being passed to and from all 
the methods and thus resulting in a bottleneck. In this release we use 
global variables to represent the contingency table.

Programs
--------

A few changes in statistic.pl were required to incorporate the changes in 
the various Measures.
