Utils
-----

(1)     Total rewrite of Utils/kocos.pl to make it more efficient 
	and reliable. kocos allows a user to find Kth order 
        co-occurrences of a given target word or target regexes.
	The process of identifying "cycles" in the co-occurrence
        chains has been significantly improved, and problems that
	existed in handling special characters such as . and ,
        have been resolved. In addition kocos now only displays
	the Kth order co-occurrences. Previously it displayed the
	1st through Kth order co-occurrences. ADP.05

(2)     Because of (1) program socs.pl has been removed from NSP.
        It was provided in .55 as a fast alternative to kocos for
	2nd order co-occurrences only. Since kocos is now much 
	faster it is no longer needed and is superseded.

(3)	Added Utils/combig.pl. This program converts output from count.pl 
	such that bigrams are treated as unordered word pairs. count views 
	a bigram "W1 W2" as W1 preceding W2, while combig.pl views bigram  
	"W1 W2" as W1 and W2 occurring together in either order. 

(4)     Added script/drivers for combig.pl (combig-script.sh).

(5)     Changed version number of rank.pl from 0.5 to 0.01 to make 
	it consistent with current numbering scheme. rank.pl has 
	not been modified since the very early days of BSP. 

count.pl
--------
(1)     display value of --remove in --extended output TDP.57.1

(2)     make sure source and destination file exist TDP.57.2

(3)     minor rewording of warning/error messages

statistic.pl
------------

(1)     make sure source and destination file exist TDP.57.3

(2)     minor re-wording of warning/error messages


Testing
-------	

(1)     Added test cases for new Util combig.

(2)     Added new tests cases for kocos.pl.

(3)     Modified test case for count.pl --extended for TDP.57.1

(4)     Modified test cases for count.pl and statistic.pl due to
        rewording of warning and error messages.
