Makefile.PL
-----------

In response to a number of reports to rt.cpan.org, I have
modified the Makefile.PL so that documentation is installed
in system default directories. Previously we were forcing
the installation to occur in certain directories. 

/Testing
--------

I have set the files and directories in the /Testing subdirectory
to be executable.
