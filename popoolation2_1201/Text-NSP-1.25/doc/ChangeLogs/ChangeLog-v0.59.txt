Measures
--------

(1)    	repaired the measures phi.pm, tscore.pm, odds.pm, and 
	rightFisher.pm. None of them were set up as proper statistics
	modules and did not work. They did not have initializeStatistic
	functions, nor did they have other necessary components. These
	were user submitted functions, and should have been tested before
	inclusion in NSP. In future all such submissions will be tested
	before inclusion. 
	
Testing
-------	

(1)     Added test scripts for phi.pm, tscore.pm, odds.pm, and 
	rightFisher.pm.

(2)     Added test scripts for tmi3.pm, which was also a user submitted
	module which functioned ok but had minimal test scripts associated
	with it.
