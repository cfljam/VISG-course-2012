Programs
--------
	Made file references platform independent through the use of the 
	File and Config modules, rather than hard-coding paths with Unix 
	style names. Affects all files in /Meassures and statistic.pl. 
	Note that we may need to change this yet again, if we decide to 
	have modules found in a more standard way (using PERL5LIB). Right
	now modules are looked for in the PATH, which is somewhat 
	non-standard. 						(Mahesh)

Documentation
-------------
	
	Expanded documentation for log-likelihood ratio to provide a
	definition, and clarified phi documentation to point out that
	in fact it is phi^2. Also clarified documentation for Pearson's
	test. 							(Ted)
