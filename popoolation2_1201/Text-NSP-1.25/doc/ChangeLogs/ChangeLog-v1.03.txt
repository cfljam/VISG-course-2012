Saiyam fixed the Divide by Zero error that
was being generated with tables of the form :

9 0 | 9
0 0 | 0
----- 
9 0   9

and 

9  0 | 9
6  0 | 6
------ 
15 0  15

Rather than generating divide by zero errors, these tables are
independent and should report scores that reflect that (depending
on the measure invoked). This error affected the measures ll and x2.
