The CVS directories were left by mistake in version 0.99.
They have been removed in version 1.01. This does not affect
the functionality of the package, but it takes up a lot
of space, and is sort of messy. It also causes one of the
test scripts to fail (the one that checks the --recurse
option in count.pl)
