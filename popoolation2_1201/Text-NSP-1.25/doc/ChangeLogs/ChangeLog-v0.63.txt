CPAN Release
------------

	1) NSP is now distributed via CPAN as Text::NSP.

  	   http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-NSP/

  	   In order to take advantage of CPANs distribution
	   mechanism, we needed to rename a few files, and
	   add a dummy module stub (NSP.pm). NSP still works
	   the same as it always did, it just looks slightly
	   different now. Files that were added or renamed 
	   because of CPAN include INSTALL, README, CHANGES, 
	   MANIFEST, NSP.pm, and Makefile.PL. There is also a
	   directory /t that is to be used for testing (invoked
	   via make test). Right now there isn't much that is
	   tested there, but that could/should change in future.
	   We still have very extensive testing available via
	   /Testing, it just isn't integrated into "make test"
	   at this time.
