Makefile.PL
------------

	Updated Makefile.PL with correct version number (Ted)

	Makefile.PL now creates /man/man3 directory - in previous
	versions this was not created, sometimes causing an error
	during "make install" when that directory is not found (Ted)

Programs
---------
	statistic.pl and sort-bigrams.pl were modified by changing
	the internal N-gram separating marker # to sequence <||>.
	As some users pointed out, use of # as a separator between
	the N-grams causes problems when N-gram tokens include #.
	In 0.71, we used a more rare sequence <||> to separate
	N-grams in the internal hash structure. (Amruta)
	
Testing
-------

	Added test cases to catch an error when internal delimiter <||> 
	is detected within N-gram tokens.
	(Amruta)

	Fixed test cases for huge-count, that were relying on the mistaken
	idea that count.pl produces output in sorted form. Now an actual
	sort is done of count.pl output before comparison with gold 
	standard results. (Amruta)
