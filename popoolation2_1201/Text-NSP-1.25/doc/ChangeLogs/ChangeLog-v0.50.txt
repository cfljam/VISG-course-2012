Program count.pl:
-----------------

1. Salient changes: 

   a. Support for n-grams, as opposed to only bigrams.

   b. Support for user-defined token definitions. 

   c. Output format is different and explicitly demarcates tokens in
      the ngrams. 'Extended' output is also supported (see below). 

2. New switches in version 0.5: 

   a. --ngram => allows creation of ngrams with more than 2 tokens per
      ngram. Version 0.3 only allowed bigrams.

   b. --token => allows user definition of what a token should be for
      creation of ngrams. Version 0.3 had two fixed regular
      expressions: these are the defaults of version 0.5. 

   c. --set_freq_combo, --get_freq_combo => allows user control on the
      number of frequency values to show per ngram. Version 0.3 only
      allowed bigrams, and so there were only 3 values to be printed,
      and no user control was allowed.  

   d. --remove => allows for the removal of ngrams that fall below a
      given threshold. Scores dont show the ngrams that are removed. 

   e. --newLine => prevents ngram from spanning across the new line
      character. Version 0.3 always considers the new line character
      to be a white space character.  

   f. --extended => creates an 'extended' output where the values of
      switches used are also output.  


Program statistic.pl:
---------------------

1. Salient changes:

   a. Support for n-grams, as opposed to only bigrams.

   b. Performs error handling for library routines and allows routines
      to throw errors. 

2. New switches in version 0.5:

   a. --ngram => allows user to specify the size of incoming ngrams.

   b. --set_freq_combo FILE, --get_freq_combo => allows user to
      specify what frequency values are available for the ngrams in
      the incoming ngram list file.

   c. --extended => informs statistic.pl that incoming ngram file may
      have extended data in it and also requests statistic.pl to
      create its own extended data in the lines of count.pl above. 


Program rank.pl:
----------------

1. Salient changes: 

   a. Changes in inputs: This program no longer takes as input two
      libraries and one frequency file to compute the rank correlation
      coefficient. Instead it takes as input two files containing the
      same ngrams sorted using two different statistical measures, and
      then computes the rank correlation coefficient for the ngrams
      that are pressent in both the files. using the two
      files.

   b. Changes in outputs: As before this program outputs the
      correlation coefficient. Unlike before however the ngrams and
      their ranks are not output since these are already available in
      the input files.

2. Helper script: 

   We provide a helper script rank-script.sh to emulate the rank.pl
   program of BSP version 0.3. See Readme.txt for more information on
   this script.
