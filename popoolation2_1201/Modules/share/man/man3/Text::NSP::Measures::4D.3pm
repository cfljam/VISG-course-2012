.IX Title "Text::NSP::Measures::4D 3"
.TH Text::NSP::Measures::4D 3 "2010-11-13" "perl v5.8.8" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
Text::NSP::Measures::4D \- Perl module that provides basic framework for
                          building measure of association for 4\-grams.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
This module can be used as a foundation for building 4\-dimensional
measures of association that can then be used by statistic.pl. In
particular this module provides methods that give convenient access to
4\-d (i.e., 4\-gram) frequency counts as created by count.pl, as well as
some degree of error handling that verifies the data.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The methods in this module retrieve observed 4\-gram frequency counts and
marginal totals, and also compute expected values. They also provide
support for error checking of the output produced by count.pl. These
methods are used in all the 4\-gram (4d) measure modules provided in \s-1NSP\s0.
If you are writing your own 4d measure, you can use these methods as well.
.PP
With 4\-gram or 4d measures we use a 4x4 contingency table to store the
frequency counts associated with each word in the trigram, as well as the
number of times the trigram occurs. The notation we employ is as follows:
.PP
Marginal Frequencies:
