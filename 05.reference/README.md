#Reference Files for Read Mapping#

The fasta files contain homozygous reference line assemblies for each pool.

The script indexes these for use in [bwa ](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml)

The file refereces.gff was generated by mapping cDNA sequences for the same genes using [gmap](http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/)
